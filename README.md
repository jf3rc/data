# Data Clean Up

This repository will address how to clean up data in R Studio and Python (using spyder). This will include topics such as removing missing data values, encoding dummy variables, splitting data into test and train sets, and feature scaling.

The templates provided should be used as first steps or frameworks in order to clean up an initial data set before continuing with modeling or any other analysis. Use the attached Data.csv file as a sample dataset. Contact jf3rc@virginia.edu with any questions.
