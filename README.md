# Data Clean Up

This repository will address how to clean up data in R Studio and Python (using spyder). This will include topics such as removing missing data values, encoding dummy variables, splitting a data into test and train sets, and feature scaling.

Please note that the supporting documents will be shown as code frameworks so no datasets will be provided. Contact jf3rc@virginia.edu with any questions.
