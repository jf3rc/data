# Data Clean Up

This repository will address how to clean up data in R Studio and Python (using spyder). This will include topics such as removing missing data values, encoding dummy variables, splitting a data into test and train sets, and feature scaling.

The templates provided should be used as first steps in order to clean up an initial data set before continuing with modeling or any other analysis. The provided supporting documents should be used as code frameworks. Contact jf3rc@virginia.edu with any questions.
